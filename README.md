This repository demonstrates Git's branching, cloning, merging, and pulling functionality. 
The master branch was first created, and then we proceeded to create r2_contact and r2_index branches using two separate computers (to simulate multi-user development) and implemented a simple unique function for each branch. We then merged the master branch with other branches via 'pull' and 'push' method. As the result, the master branch now contains functions implemented in the branches.
